# Creating a Password Generator

## Employee seeking to build a strong password generator for greater security

An employee with access to sensitive data wanted a password generator which will produce strong passwords that meet certain criteria. They required a customizable password generator to ensure the passwords provided will ensure in greater security. In specific, they were looking for the final product to meet the following standards:
1. When the button to generate password is clicked, the user must be presented with with a series of prompts regarding password criteria.
2. The user is given an option of whether or not to include the given password criteria.
3. The user can choose a length of 8-128 characters for the length of the password.
4. The user must choose whether or not to include the following character types: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
5. When the user answers each prompt, the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
6. When all prompts are answered, then a password matching the selected criteria should be generated.
7. The generated password must be dislayed as an alert or written to the page.

In addition to meeting all the criteria given by the employee, I ensured all the responses were working (including if the user did not choose to include any character type), additional instructions were given to the user (e.g. when the character length did not meet the requirements or how to start/retry), and the responsive user interface adapted to multiple screen sizes.

This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
